1. Load and check data
2. Data Analysis  
      Understand the distribution of values of columns and compare columns against the target column, "Survived"
3. Data Wrangling
      - Check for null values 
      - Set categorial values 
      - Remove miscellaneous columns
4. Cross Validation
      - Label dependent and independent variables
      - Split data into train and test 
      - Fit the model
      - Predict test values of dependent variable
5. Accuracy Testing
      - Classification Report
      - Confusion Matrix
      - Accuracy 
      
This is for practice
